**For each pack verify:**
- [ ] SME Calibration Summary references the correct knowledge pack
- [ ] Terminology depth matches the audience level
- [ ] Regulatory awareness matches the industry
- [ ] Evidence standards are applied correctly
- [ ] Domain-specific validation catches industry-specific pitfalls

### 7.2 Scoring Thresholds

Verify `config/scoring-thresholds.json`:
- [ ] `phase_3_5_visual_assets` quality gate present (require_data_chart_verification, min_visual_density, require_alt_text, require_captions)
- [ ] `phase_4_to_3_5` feedback loop limit = 1
- [ ] Regulated industries (pharma, bfsi, healthcare, legal) use stricter thresholds
- [ ] Higher minimum citation accuracy for regulated content
- [ ] Max 5 total feedback loops

### 7.3 Brand Registry Template

Verify `config/brand-registry-template.json`:
- [ ] `industry` field accepts all 10 knowledge pack names
- [ ] `seo_preferences.internal_linking` has `sitemap_url`, `page_registry`, `pillar_pages`
- [ ] `google_integration` section present (`credentials_path`, `tracking_sheet_id`, `drive_output_folder_id`)

- [ ] No Python errors or tracebacks

### 8.2 PreToolUse — Hallucination Detection (Write/Edit)

**Test:** Generate content and watch for the hallucination check during Write/Edit operations

**Expected behavior:**
- [ ] Hook fires on Write/Edit of content deliverables
- [ ] Hook SKIPs for non-content files (plugin config, scripts, etc.)

**Test with intentionally bad content — the hook should catch all three:**

| Bad Content | Expected Detection |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "Studies show 87% of companies..." (no source) | CRITICAL — unattributed statistic |
| "Visit https://example.com/dashboard" | CRITICAL — placeholder URL |
| "The #1 leading solution in the market" | WARNING — unsubstantiated superlative |

**Additional checks:**
- [ ] Fix suggestions provided for each flag
- [ ] Severity levels correct (CRITICAL for stats/URLs in headlines, WARNING for body text)
- [ ] Doesn't over-flag — legitimate cited statistics pass through

- [ ] Chart assets uploaded to assets subfolder
- [ ] File metadata correct (name, MIME type)

### 10.4 Without Google Credentials

**Test:** Run the full pipeline without Google credentials configured

**Expected:**
- [ ] Pipeline completes normally — no crash
- [ ] Graceful message about Google integration not configured
- [ ] Content saved locally to `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/`
- [ ] No error loops or retries

---

## 11. Multi-Backend Tests

### 11.1 Backend Selection During Brand Setup

**Test:** Run `/brand-setup` or `/cf:style-guide` and reach Step G

**Expected:**
- [ ] Three options presented: Google Sheets + Drive, Airtable, Local
- [ ] Google and Airtable are primary options (presented first)
- [ ] Local available but only if explicitly chosen or skipped
- [ ] Skipping defaults to local with a message about `/cf:switch-backend`
- [ ] Choosing Google triggers service account setup guidance
- [ ] Choosing Airtable triggers token creation guidance
- [ ] Brand profile `tracking.backend` field is set correctly

### 11.2 Pipeline with Each Backend

**Test:** Run a full pipeline with each backend configured

| Backend | What to Verify |
|---------|---------------|
| **Local** | tracking.json updated, .docx in organized outputs/ directory |
| **Airtable** | Airtable record created/updated, .docx attached as attachment |
| **Google** | Sheet row created/updated, .docx uploaded to Drive folder |

### 11.3 Backend Switching

**Test:** `/cf:switch-backend airtable` (while currently on local)

**Expected:**
- [ ] Current backend identified and record count shown
- [ ] Target backend validated (AIRTABLE_TOKEN check)
- [ ] Migration offered (yes/no/skip)
- [ ] If "yes": records migrated, files attached, summary shown
- [ ] Brand profile updated to new backend
- [ ] Source data preserved (never deleted)

### 11.4 Backend Migration

**Test:** Migrate from local to Airtable with existing tracking data

**Expected:**
- [ ] All records copied to Airtable
- [ ] Output files attached to Airtable records
- [ ] Migration is idempotent (re-running doesn't create duplicates)
- [ ] Summary shows records_migrated, files_migrated, files_failed counts
- [ ] Source local data remains intact at `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/tracking/`

### 11.5 Pipeline Performance Tracking

**Test:** Run a full pipeline and check the completion summary

**Expected:**
- [ ] PIPELINE PERFORMANCE section has actual times (not placeholder estimates)
- [ ] Per-phase timing table with: Phase, Name, Time, Benchmark, Status, Iterations
- [ ] Phases with feedback loops show correct iteration count
- [ ] Total processing time matches sum of phase times
- [ ] Benchmark comparison shows under/over with correct content type
- [ ] TOKEN USAGE ESTIMATE section present with: Agent Instructions, Content, Config, Subtotal, Overhead, Total
- [ ] Disclaimer: "Token estimates are approximate. For precise session costs, use /cost."

### 11.6 setup.py Backend Detection

**Test:** Start a session with different env vars set

**Expected:**
- [ ] With `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` set: shows "AIRTABLE_TOKEN=configured"
- [ ] Without `AIRTABLE_TOKEN`: shows "AIRTABLE_TOKEN=not_configured"
- [ ] TRACKING_BACKENDS lists all available backends (always includes "local")
- [ ] Google credentials check still works as before

## 12. Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

### 11.1 Empty/Minimal Input

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| `/contentforge` (no topic) | Asks for topic, doesn't crash |
| `/brand-setup` (no name) | Asks for brand name |
| `/cf:translate` (no language) | Asks for target language |
| `/cf:connect` (no service name) | Shows available connectors |
| `/cf:help` (no argument) | Shows full help overview |

### 11.2 Very Long Content

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Whitepaper 5000+ words | Pipeline completes, all phases handle length |
| Topic with 50+ research sources | Phase 2 handles gracefully, may take longer |
| Very long brand name (100+ chars) | Paths handled correctly, no truncation issues |

### 11.3 Unsupported Industry

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Brand with industry "aerospace" | Falls back to general defaults (no knowledge pack), warns user |
| Brand with industry "" (empty) | Uses defaults, no crash |
| Brand with misspelled industry "tecnology" | Should suggest "technology" or fall back |

### 11.4 Special Characters in Brand Names

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Apostrophe: "O'Reilly Media" | Drive uploader uses client-side matching (no query injection) |
| Spaces: "Test Brand Alpha" | Paths handled correctly |
| Unicode: "Cafe Express" | No encoding errors |
| Ampersand: "Johnson & Johnson" | No URL encoding issues in Drive/Sheets |

### 11.5 Network Failures

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Run pipeline without internet | Research phase handles gracefully, may ask for manual input |
| MCP connector timeout | Skill shows error, doesn't crash pipeline |
| Google API quota exceeded | Script shows quota error, content saved locally |

### 11.6 Concurrent Operations

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| `/batch-process` with 5 pieces | Queue managed, no interleaving of outputs |
| Start pipeline while another is running | Handled gracefully (queued or error message) |

### 11.7 Pipeline Interruption

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Cancel mid-pipeline (Ctrl+C or close session) | No corrupt data, can restart |
| Reconnect after interruption | Fresh start, no stale state |
