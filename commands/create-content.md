# Create Content

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Transform a content requirement into a publication-ready, fact-checked, brand-compliant, SEO-optimized piece through a 10-phase autonomous agent pipeline with three-layer fact verification and zero hallucinations.

## Trigger

User runs `/create-content` or asks to write, draft, create, or produce content (articles, blog posts, whitepapers, FAQs, or research papers).

## Inputs

Gather the following from the user. If not provided, ask before proceeding:

1. **Topic** — the subject the content is about (e.g., "AI in Healthcare", "remote work productivity tips")

2. **Content type** — one of:
   - Article (1500-3000 words)
   - Blog post (800-1500 words)
   - Whitepaper (3000-6000 words)
   - FAQ (structured Q&A format)
   - Research paper (2000-5000 words with methodology)

3. **Brand** — which brand profile to use for voice and compliance. If not specified, ask: "Which brand should I use? Or create a new one with `/brand-setup`."

4. **Target audience** (optional) — who this content is for (e.g., "Healthcare CIOs", "Small business owners")

5. **Additional context** (optional):
   - Primary keyword for SEO optimization
   - Word count target (overrides content type default)
   - Tone override (authoritative, conversational, technical, witty)
   - Specific sources or references to include
   - Competitor URLs to differentiate from

## Pre-Flight Validation (Before Title Curation)

**This check runs automatically before any content production begins.**

After gathering inputs (topic, type, brand, audience, keyword), validate the brand profile:

1. **Load brand profile** from `~/.claude-marketing/{brand}/` or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/{brand}/`
2. **Check required fields:**
   - `voice.tone` — must be set (not empty)
   - `voice.formality` — must be set
   - `terminology.prohibited_terms` — should be non-empty for regulated industries
   - `guardrails.prohibited_claims` — **REQUIRED** for pharma, BFSI, healthcare, legal industries; recommended for all
   - `target_audience.primary_persona` — should include role, reading level
   - `industry` — must match an available industry knowledge pack

3. **If any required field is missing, warn the user:**
```
⚠️ Brand profile check:
  ✓ Voice/tone: [value]
  ✓ Formality: [value]
  ✗ Guardrails: EMPTY — compliance checks will be skipped
  ✗ Audience persona: MISSING — content may not match reader expectations

For regulated industries (pharma, BFSI, healthcare, legal), guardrails are REQUIRED.

Options:
  1. Continue anyway (defaults applied where possible)
  2. Fix brand profile first (/cf:style-guide --update [brand])
```

4. **Wait for user response.** Do not auto-proceed with incomplete profiles for regulated industries.

## Title Curation (Before Pipeline Starts)

**This step is mandatory.** After gathering the inputs above, generate **4-5 title options** before starting Phase 1. Do NOT auto-select a title or skip straight to research.

**How it works:**

1. Use the topic, content type, brand context, audience, and primary keyword to generate **4-5 distinct title options**, each taking a different angle:
   - **Benefit-driven** — Leads with the value the reader gets
   - **How-to / Tactical** — Actionable, instructional framing
   - **Data-driven / Stat-led** — Opens with a compelling number or trend
   - **Question-based / Curiosity** — Provokes the reader to click
   - **Contrarian / Unexpected** — Challenges conventional thinking

2. Each title option must:
   - Include the primary keyword naturally
   - Stay within character limits for the content type (blog: 40-60, article: 50-70, whitepaper: 60-100)
   - Be specific (not generic)

3. Present all options to the user and ask them to **select one, modify one, or request more options**. The user may also provide their own title.

4. **Only after the user confirms a title**, proceed to Phase 1 Research with the confirmed title.

**Example:**

```
Topic: AI in Healthcare
Type: Article
Keyword: AI healthcare 2026

Title Options:
  1. How AI Is Reshaping Healthcare Delivery in 2026 — And What Leaders Must Do Now
  2. AI in Healthcare 2026: 7 Breakthroughs That Are Actually Reaching Patients
  3. Why 73% of Hospitals Are Betting on AI Healthcare Tools in 2026
  4. The Healthcare AI Playbook: From Pilot Programs to Patient Outcomes
  5. AI Healthcare in 2026: What the Hype Cycle Gets Wrong

Which title would you like to use? You can select a number, modify one, or provide your own.

## The 10-Phase Pipeline

Each phase has a quality gate. If any phase fails, the pipeline loops back with feedback (max 5 loops before human escalation).

### Phase 1: Research Agent
- Uses the **confirmed title** as the anchor for all research
- SERP analysis of top-ranking content for the topic
- Source mining — identify 10+ authoritative sources
- Competitive content analysis — what exists, what's missing
- Structured outline with section descriptions and citation targets

### Phase 2: Fact Checker (Layer 1)
- URL verification — confirm all sources are accessible and current
- Claim validation — cross-reference key claims against multiple sources
- Confidence scoring — rate each fact claim (verified, likely, unverified)

### Phase 3: Content Drafter
- First draft with brand voice applied throughout
- SME calibration via industry knowledge packs (terminology, regulatory, evidence standards)
- Inline citations for every factual claim
- Word count targeting within 10% of specification
- Natural flow with transitions between sections

### Phase 3.5: Visual Asset Annotator
- Chart generation from verified research statistics (matplotlib)
- Visual opportunity identification and annotation markers
- Asset manifest with placement, alt text, and data sources
- TODO markers for visuals requiring human action (screenshots, photos)

### Phase 4: Scientific Validator (Layer 2)
- Hallucination detection — flag any claim not backed by cited sources
- Unsourced claim flagging — identify statements presented as fact without evidence
- Logic validation — check argument flow and reasoning consistency

### Phase 5: Structurer & Proofreader
- Grammar and spelling correction
- Readability optimization (target: grade 8-10 for general, grade 12+ for technical)
- Brand compliance check (terminology, restricted words, mandatory disclaimers)
- Formatting standardization

### Phase 6: SEO/GEO Optimizer
- Primary keyword optimization (title, H1, first 100 words, subheadings)
- Meta title and description generation
- Internal linking suggestions
- AI answer engine readiness (structured for Google AI Overviews, Perplexity)
- GEO score (1-10) for citation-worthiness

### Phase 6.5: Humanizer
- AI pattern removal — eliminate predictable sentence structures, filler phrases, hedge words
- Sentence variety (burstiness) — mix short punchy sentences with longer complex ones
- Brand personality injection — apply configured personality profile
- Industry-specific AI telltale removal

### Phase 7: Reviewer (Layer 3)
- 5-dimension quality scoring:
  - Content Quality (30%) — depth, accuracy, originality
  - Citation Integrity (25%) — source quality, link health, attribution
  - Brand Compliance (20%) — voice match, terminology, restrictions
  - SEO Performance (15%) — keyword usage, meta tags, structure
  - Readability (10%) — flow, clarity, engagement
- Composite score with pass/fail gate (7.0 minimum)
- Specific revision recommendations if below threshold

### Phase 8: Output Manager
- Generate .docx output with professional formatting
- Upload to ~~knowledge base (Google Drive) if connected
- Update tracking sheet with production metadata
- Generate social-ready excerpt for promotion

## Output

The final output includes:
- Publication-ready content piece with inline citations
- Quality scorecard (5 dimensions + composite)
- SEO meta package (title, description, keywords)
- Production metadata (word count, reading time, sources used, pipeline duration)

## After Content Creation

Ask: "Would you like me to:
- Promote this on social media? (`/social-adapt`)
- Publish to your CMS? (`/publish`)
- Translate for other markets? (`/translate`)
- Create A/B headline variants? (`/variants`)
- Generate a content brief for a related topic? (`/brief`)
- Run batch production for multiple topics? (`/batch-process`)"
