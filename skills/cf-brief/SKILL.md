# Content Brief Generator

Generate a comprehensive, research-backed content brief from a keyword or topic. The brief includes keyword data, competitor content analysis, search intent classification, audience pain points, a recommended outline, and an actionable SEO strategy — everything a writer needs to produce high-ranking content on the first draft.

## When to Use

Use `/cf:brief` when:
- You need a **structured content brief** before starting production with `/contentforge`
- You want **data-driven keyword research** to inform topic selection
- You need to **analyze competitor content** to find gaps and differentiation angles
- You're planning a content calendar and need briefs for multiple upcoming pieces
- A client or stakeholder requires a **brief for approval** before production begins
- You want to understand **search intent** before committing to a content type

**For direct content production** (brief + draft in one step), use `/contentforge` instead.
**For multiple briefs in parallel**, run `/cf:brief` for each topic individually (batch brief support planned for v2.2).

## What This Command Does

1. **Keyword Research** — Primary keyword analysis with search volume, keyword difficulty, related keywords, LSI terms, and long-tail opportunities
2. **Competitor Content Analysis** — Analyze top 5 ranking pages for word count, structure, key points covered, content gaps, and unique angles
3. **Search Intent Classification** — Determine whether the query is informational, commercial, transactional, or navigational, and recommend content type accordingly
4. **Audience Pain Points & Questions** — Map target audience needs, common questions, forum discussions, and "People Also Ask" patterns
5. **Recommended Outline** — Generate a structured outline with title options, section descriptions, word count allocations, and citation targets per section
6. **SEO Strategy** — Keyword density targets, meta title/description recommendations, internal linking opportunities, featured snippet potential, and schema markup suggestions
7. **Success Metrics** — Define measurable goals: target word count, minimum citations, readability target, quality score goal, and expected production time

## Required Inputs

**Minimum Required:**
- **Keyword or Topic** — The primary keyword or topic to build the brief around (e.g., "AI in healthcare 2026", "best project management tools")
- **Target Audience** — Who this content is for (e.g., "Healthcare CIOs", "Small business owners", "Marketing managers at B2B SaaS companies")

**Optional:**
- **Content Type** — article, blog, whitepaper, faq, video-script (if not specified, the brief recommends the best type based on search intent)
- **Competitor URLs** — 1-5 specific competitor pages to analyze (if not provided, top 5 SERP results are used)
- **SEO Goals** — Primary goal: `traffic` (maximize organic visits), `conversions` (target bottom-of-funnel intent), or `awareness` (brand visibility and thought leadership)
- **Brand** — Brand profile name to align voice/terminology recommendations in the brief

## How to Use

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```
/cf:brief
```
**Prompts you for:**
1. Keyword or topic
2. Target audience
3. Content type (or let the brief recommend one)
4. Competitor URLs (skip to use SERP top 5)
5. SEO goal (traffic / conversions / awareness)

### Quick Mode (All Parameters)
```
/cf:brief "AI diagnostics precision medicine" --audience="Healthcare Executives" --type=article --goal=traffic
```

### With Competitor URLs
```
/cf:brief "best CRM for startups" --audience="Startup founders" --competitors="https://example1.com/crm-guide,https://example2.com/best-crm" --goal=conversions
```

### With Brand Context
```
/cf:brief "cloud security best practices" --audience="IT Directors" --brand=AcmeTech --type=whitepaper
```

## What Happens

### Phase 1: Keyword Research (2-3 minutes)

Gather keyword data for the primary keyword and discover related opportunities.

**Data Collected:**
- **Primary Keyword:** Search volume (monthly), keyword difficulty (0-100), CPC indicator, trend direction
- **Related Keywords:** 10-15 semantically related terms with volume and difficulty
- **LSI Keywords:** 8-12 latent semantic indexing terms for natural content enrichment
- **Long-Tail Opportunities:** 5-8 long-tail variants with lower difficulty and clear intent
- **Question Keywords:** 5-10 question-format queries from "People Also Ask" and forums

**MCP Integration:**
- **Ahrefs (optional, HTTP):** If connected, pulls real search volume, keyword difficulty, SERP features, and related keywords from the Ahrefs API. Data is more accurate and comprehensive than estimates.
- **Similarweb (optional, HTTP):** If connected, pulls traffic estimates for competitor URLs and category benchmarks.
- **Without MCP:** Uses web search analysis, SERP pattern analysis, and heuristic estimation for keyword metrics. Results are directionally accurate but less precise than API data.

**Example Output:**
```

================================================================
```

**Quality Gate:** Must identify primary keyword with volume estimate, 10+ related keywords, and 5+ long-tail opportunities.

### Phase 2: Competitor Content Analysis (3-5 minutes)

Analyze top 5 ranking pages (or provided competitor URLs) to identify patterns, gaps, and differentiation opportunities.

**For Each Competitor:**
- **URL and Domain Authority:** Page URL, estimated domain strength
- **Word Count:** Total content length
- **Content Structure:** H1/H2/H3 hierarchy and section topics
- **Key Points Covered:** Main arguments, data points, examples used
- **Content Gaps:** What's missing, outdated, or insufficiently covered
- **Unique Angle:** What differentiates this piece from others

**Aggregate Analysis:**
- **Average Word Count:** Across top 5 results
- **Common Sections:** Topics that appear in 3+ competitor pieces
- **Universal Gaps:** Topics that NO competitor covers well
- **Content Freshness:** Publication dates, last-updated dates
- **Format Patterns:** Listicles vs. guides vs. research-style content

**Example Output:**
```
Competitor Content Analysis
================================================================

Competitor #1: healthtechmagazine.com/ai-diagnostics-guide
  Word Count: 2,850
  Structure: 8 H2 sections (intro, definition, use cases x4, challenges, future)
  Strengths: Comprehensive use cases, good data visualizations
  Gaps: No 2026 data, no cost analysis, no implementation guide

Competitor #2: mckinsey.com/healthcare/ai-diagnostics
  Word Count: 3,200
  Structure: 6 H2 sections (executive summary, market size, applications, barriers, recommendations, appendix)
  Strengths: Strong data and market projections, authoritative tone
  Gaps: Overly theoretical, no practitioner perspective, paywalled sources

... (3 more)

Aggregate Findings:
  Average Word Count: 2,640 (range: 1,800 - 3,200)
  Common Sections: Definition, Use Cases, Benefits, Challenges, Future Outlook
  Universal Gaps:
    - No piece covers 2026 regulatory changes (FDA AI/ML framework update)
    - No practical implementation timeline or cost framework
    - Limited real-world case studies from 2025-2026
    - No comparison of AI diagnostic platforms/vendors
  Format: 4/5 are long-form guides, 1 is research-style
  Freshness: 3/5 published before 2025 (outdated data)
================================================================
```

**Quality Gate:** Must analyze at least 3 competitor pages with word count, structure, and identified gaps.

### Phase 3: Search Intent Classification (1-2 minutes)

Classify the primary keyword's search intent and recommend the optimal content type.

**Intent Categories:**
- **Informational:** User wants to learn (how-to, what-is, guide). Best content types: article, blog, whitepaper
- **Commercial Investigation:** User is comparing options before a decision. Best content types: article, whitepaper, comparison guide
- **Transactional:** User is ready to act (buy, sign up, download). Best content types: landing page, product page, FAQ
- **Navigational:** User is looking for a specific page or brand. Best content types: FAQ, product page

**Intent Signals Analyzed:**
- SERP composition (what types of pages rank?)
- Query modifiers ("best", "how to", "vs", "buy", "reviews")
- Featured snippet format (paragraph, list, table)
- Ads presence and positioning
- "People Also Ask" question types

**Example Output:**
```
Search Intent Classification
================================================================

Primary Intent: Commercial Investigation (72% confidence)
Secondary Intent: Informational (28% confidence)

Evidence:
  - SERP shows 3 comparison/guide pages, 2 vendor pages
  - "precision medicine" modifier suggests professional research
  - Featured snippet is a definition paragraph (informational signal)
  - 2 ads present targeting enterprise buyers (commercial signal)
  - People Also Ask skews toward "how" and "what" (informational)

Recommended Content Type: Article (long-form guide)
  Rationale: Mixed intent favors comprehensive guide that educates
  AND positions solutions. Article format matches 4/5 top results.

Alternative: Whitepaper
  If targeting enterprise decision-makers specifically, a whitepaper
  with gated download could capture higher-intent leads.

Word Count Recommendation: 2,500-3,000 words
  Rationale: Avg competitor is 2,640 words. To compete, match or
  exceed by 10-15% while adding unique depth.
================================================================
```

### Phase 4: Audience Pain Points & Questions (2-3 minutes)

Map the target audience's needs, frustrations, and information gaps related to the topic.

**Research Sources:**
- "People Also Ask" patterns from SERP
- Forum discussions (Reddit, Quora, industry forums)
- Review sites and comment sections
- Social media conversations
- Industry reports and surveys

**Analysis Produces:**
- **Top 5 Pain Points:** Ranked by frequency and severity
- **Top 10 Questions:** Questions the audience is actively asking
- **Knowledge Gaps:** What the audience doesn't know they don't know
- **Desired Outcomes:** What success looks like for this audience
- **Language Patterns:** How the audience talks about this topic (terminology, tone)

## Output Example

```
Content Brief: "AI Diagnostics in Precision Medicine"
Generated: 2026-02-25T14:30:00Z
Processing Time: 12 minutes

Brief Summary:
  Primary Keyword: "AI diagnostics precision medicine" (~2,400/mo, KD 62)
  Recommended Type: Article (long-form guide)
  Target Word Count: 2,750-3,000
  Target Citations: 20-25
  Competitor Avg Word Count: 2,640
  Universal Gap: No competitor covers vendor evaluation or
    implementation timelines

  Outline Sections: 7 + intro + conclusion
  SEO Strategy: 1.8-2.2% primary density, featured snippet target,
    Article schema markup
  Quality Score Goal: 8.5+/10
  Expected Production Time: 25-30 min via /contentforge

Brief saved to:
  Google Drive: ContentForge Briefs/AI-Diagnostics-Precision-Medicine-Brief.md
```

## Workflow: Brief to Production

### Step 1: Generate Brief
```
/cf:brief "AI diagnostics precision medicine" --audience="Healthcare Executives" --type=article --goal=traffic
```

### Step 2: Review and Approve Brief
- Review the outline, keyword targets, and competitor analysis
- Adjust sections, add/remove topics, modify word count
- Share with stakeholders for approval if needed

### Step 3: Produce Content from Brief
```
/contentforge "AI Diagnostics in Precision Medicine: 2026 Executive Guide" --type=article --brand=AcmeMed --audience="Healthcare Executives" --keyword="AI diagnostics precision medicine" --brief=ContentForge-Briefs/AI-Diagnostics-Brief.md
```
When a `--brief` parameter is provided, ContentForge uses the brief's outline, keyword map, citation targets, and SEO strategy instead of running its own Phase 1 research from scratch. This produces more targeted content and saves 3-5 minutes of processing time.

### Step 4: Batch Production from Multiple Briefs
Generate briefs for 10 topics, review them, then feed approved briefs into `/batch-process` for parallel production.

## MCP Integrations

### Connected (HTTP) — Optional
- **Ahrefs** — Real keyword data: search volume, keyword difficulty, related keywords, SERP features, backlink data for competitors. Significantly improves keyword research accuracy.
- **Similarweb** — Traffic estimates for competitor URLs, category benchmarks, traffic sources. Improves competitor analysis depth.

### Fallback (No MCP)
Without Ahrefs or Similarweb connected, the brief uses:
- Web search SERP analysis for keyword estimation
- SERP pattern analysis for difficulty scoring
- Heuristic models for volume estimation
- Manual competitor page analysis

Results are directionally accurate but less precise. The brief clearly labels estimated vs API-sourced data.

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient keyword data"
**Cause:** Very niche topic with low search volume or no SERP data available.
**Solution:** Broaden the keyword (e.g., "AI diagnostics" instead of "AI diagnostics for rural hospitals in Ohio"). The brief will still find related keywords and questions.

### "Only 2 competitors found"
**Cause:** Very specialized topic with few ranking pages.
**Solution:** Provide competitor URLs manually using `--competitors` flag. The brief can analyze any URL, not just top SERP results.

### "Search intent unclear (50/50 split)"
**Cause:** Keyword has genuinely mixed intent (common for broad topics).
**Solution:** The brief will recommend the content type that serves both intents. Review the recommendation and override with `--type` if you have a strong preference.

### "Brief took >15 minutes"
**Cause:** Network latency or API rate limits (especially with Ahrefs/Similarweb connected).
**Solution:** Briefs auto-retry with backoff. If persists, run without MCP data (`--no-mcp`) for faster generation with estimated data.

## Limitations

- **English keywords only** in v2.1 (multilingual keyword research planned for v2.2)
- **One brief at a time** (no batch brief generation yet)
- **Keyword data accuracy** depends on MCP connections (Ahrefs > Similarweb > heuristic estimation)
- **Competitor analysis** limited to publicly accessible pages (paywalled content cannot be analyzed)
- **Brief is a plan, not content** — still requires `/contentforge` to produce the actual piece

## Agent Used

- **Researcher (Agent 01)** — Performs keyword research, SERP analysis, competitor content analysis, and audience research. Uses MCP tools (Ahrefs, Similarweb) when connected, falls back to web search analysis when not.

## Related Skills

- **[/contentforge](../contentforge/SKILL.md)** — Produce content from a brief (accepts `--brief` parameter)
- **[/batch-process](../batch-process/SKILL.md)** — Process multiple briefs into content in parallel
- **[/cf:audit](../cf-audit/SKILL.md)** — Audit existing content to identify topics needing new briefs
- **[/cf:calendar](../cf-calendar/SKILL.md)** — Schedule brief-to-production timelines
- **[/content-refresh](../content-refresh/SKILL.md)** — Update existing content (generates refresh brief automatically)
