# Social Content Adaptation — ContentForge Post-Pipeline

Repurpose any ContentForge article into ready-to-publish social media posts for LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, and Threads. Each post is tailored to platform character limits, audience expectations, hashtag conventions, and optimal posting times.

## When to Use

Use `/cf-social-adapt` when:
- You have a **published or approved article** and want to promote it on social media
- You need **platform-native posts** (not the same text copy-pasted everywhere)
- You want **multiple posts per platform** to sustain engagement over days/weeks
- You need **hashtag strategies**, **image specifications**, and **posting schedules**
- You want to **repurpose one article into 15-25 social posts** across 5 platforms

**Do NOT use for:**
- Content still in pipeline (must be Phase 7+ approved or Phase 8 complete)
- Creating original social content from scratch (this repurposes existing articles)
- Paid ad copy (different skill set and compliance requirements)

## What This Command Does

1. **Load Source Content** -- Pull the finished article from Google Drive, local output, or by requirement ID
2. **Extract Shareworthy Moments** -- Identify 10-15 key points (statistics, insights, quotes, tips)
3. **Apply Platform Specs** -- Load character limits, hashtag rules, and format guidelines from `config/social-platform-specs.json`
4. **Generate Posts** -- Create platform-specific posts with hooks, CTAs, and engagement elements
5. **Add Metadata** -- Character counts, hashtags, image specs, recommended posting times
6. **Quality Check** -- Ensure each post is self-contained, under character limit, and has a CTA

## Required Inputs

**Minimum Required:**
- **Source Content** -- Google Drive URL, local file path, or requirement ID (e.g., `REQ-001`)
- **Platforms** -- Comma-separated list: `linkedin`, `twitter`, `instagram`, `facebook`, `threads` (or `all`)

**Optional:**
- **Posts Per Platform** -- Number of posts per platform (default: 3, max: 10)
- **Brand** -- Brand profile for voice/tone alignment (auto-detected from content metadata if not specified)
- **Campaign Hashtag** -- Branded hashtag to include in all posts (e.g., `#AcmeMedInsights`)
- **Published URL** -- URL of the live article (for link-sharing posts)
- **Image Assets** -- URLs or paths to images/graphics available for social use
- **Tone Override** -- Override brand default (e.g., `casual`, `professional`, `provocative`)

## How to Use

### Interactive Mode
```
/cf-social-adapt
```
**Prompts you for:**
1. Content source (Drive URL, file path, or requirement ID)
2. Platforms (select from list or type `all`)
3. Posts per platform (default: 3)
4. Published article URL (if available)

### Quick Mode (All Parameters)
```
/cf-social-adapt REQ-001 --platforms=linkedin,twitter,instagram --count=5 --url=https://acme-corp.com/blog/ai-healthcare-2026
```

### All Platforms, Default Count
```
/cf-social-adapt REQ-001 --platforms=all
```

### With Campaign Hashtag
```
/cf-social-adapt REQ-001 --platforms=all --hashtag=#AcmeMedInsights --count=4
```

## What Happens

### Step 1: Load and Analyze Source Content (15-30 seconds)

**Load the finished article and extract key metadata:**
```
Source Content Loaded
---------------------------------------------------
Title: "AI in Healthcare: 2026 Trends"
Brand: AcmeMed
Word Count: 1,947
Quality Score: 9.2/10
Key Topics: AI diagnostics, precision medicine, patient care, cost reduction
Primary Keyword: "AI in healthcare"
---------------------------------------------------
```

### Step 2: Extract Shareworthy Moments (30-60 seconds)

The Social Adapter Agent (`agents/10-social-adapter.md`) identifies 10-15 moments from the article that will resonate on social media.

**Extraction criteria:**
- Statistics and data points (numbers grab attention)
- Counterintuitive insights (challenge assumptions)
- Actionable tips (practical value)
- Quotable statements (from sources or the article itself)
- Provocative questions (drive engagement)
- Before/after comparisons (transformation stories)
- Lists and frameworks (easy to visualize)

**Example extraction:**
```
Shareworthy Moments Extracted: 12

1. STATISTIC: "73% of healthcare organizations now use AI-powered diagnostics, up from 12% in 2024"
2. INSIGHT: "AI diagnostic accuracy now exceeds human radiologists by 14% for early-stage cancers"
3. TIP: "Three steps to evaluate AI diagnostic tools: accuracy benchmarks, integration requirements, compliance checklist"
4. QUOTE: "The question is no longer whether to adopt AI in healthcare, but how fast you can implement it"
5. DATA: "$4.2 billion saved annually by hospitals using AI triage systems"
6. PROVOCATIVE: "Manual diagnostic processes will be considered malpractice liability by 2030"
7. COMPARISON: "AI-assisted diagnosis: 4 minutes avg vs. traditional: 45 minutes"
8. FRAMEWORK: "The 3-layer AI healthcare stack: data ingestion, model inference, clinical integration"
9. TREND: "Precision medicine powered by AI will reduce misdiagnosis rates by 60% by 2028"
10. CASE STUDY: "Cleveland Clinic reduced diagnostic wait times by 78% after implementing AI triage"
11. LIST: "Top 5 AI healthcare applications: diagnostics, drug discovery, patient monitoring, administrative automation, clinical trials"
12. ACTIONABLE: "Start with radiology -- it has the highest AI ROI and lowest integration complexity"
```

### Step 3: Generate Platform-Specific Posts (1-2 minutes)

For each platform, generate the requested number of posts using platform specs from `config/social-platform-specs.json`.

**Each post includes:**
- Platform-optimized hook (first line grabs attention)
- Body content adapted to platform voice and length
- Hashtags (platform-appropriate count and style)
- Call-to-action or engagement hook
- Character count
- Recommended image spec
- Suggested posting time

### Step 4: Quality Check

**Every post is validated against:**
- Character limit for the platform
- Self-contained meaning (reader does not need to click a link to understand the value)
- Contains a CTA or engagement hook (question, poll prompt, or link)
- Hashtags within platform norms
- No broken or placeholder content
- Brand voice alignment

## Output Format

### Per-Platform Post Set

The output is organized by platform with all metadata included.

73% of healthcare organizations now use AI-powered diagnostics.

In 2024, that number was 12%.

That is not incremental adoption. That is a seismic shift in how
medicine gets practiced -- and the organizations still running
purely manual diagnostic workflows are falling behind fast.

Three things driving this acceleration:
-- Diagnostic accuracy that exceeds human radiologists by 14%
-- Average diagnosis time dropping from 45 minutes to 4 minutes
-- $4.2 billion in annual savings from AI triage systems alone

The question is no longer whether to adopt AI in healthcare.
It is how fast you can implement it without compromising patient safety.

Hook: Actionable framework
Recommended Time: Thursday 10:00 AM

Evaluating AI diagnostic tools? Here is a 3-step framework
that Cleveland Clinic used before their 78% reduction in
diagnostic wait times:

Step 1: Accuracy Benchmarks
Compare the AI system against board-certified specialists
on your specific case mix. Generic accuracy claims are
meaningless without your patient population data.

Step 2: Integration Requirements
Map every touchpoint between the AI system and your existing
EHR, PACS, and clinical workflows. The biggest failures happen
at integration, not accuracy.

Step 3: Compliance Checklist
FDA clearance, HIPAA data handling, audit trail requirements,
and clinician override protocols. Non-negotiable.

Hook: Contrarian take
Recommended Time: Wednesday 12:00 PM

Manual diagnostic processes will be considered a malpractice
liability by 2030.

Controversial? Maybe. But consider the data:

AI diagnostic accuracy now exceeds human radiologists by 14%
for early-stage cancer detection. When a technology demonstrably
outperforms manual methods and a physician chooses not to use it,
the legal exposure is real.

This is not about replacing doctors. It is about augmenting them
with tools that catch what human eyes miss -- especially at 3 AM
on the seventh consecutive shift.

The hospitals getting this right are not asking "should we adopt AI?"
They are asking "how do we implement it responsibly?"

Quick question for healthcare professionals:

AI diagnostics now outperform human radiologists by 14% for
early-stage cancer detection. Diagnosis time drops from 45
minutes to 4 minutes.

Do you think:
A) AI-assisted diagnostics should be standard of care by 2028
B) We need more long-term data before mandating AI tools
C) It should remain a physician's choice, regardless of accuracy data

There is no wrong answer here -- we are genuinely curious where
the industry stands.

Cleveland Clinic had a problem.

Diagnostic wait times were climbing. Patient satisfaction
was dropping. And their best radiologists were burning out
from sheer volume.

Their solution? AI-powered triage.

The results:
-- 78% reduction in diagnostic wait times
-- AI accuracy exceeding their own specialists by 14%
-- Radiologists freed up for complex cases that need human judgment

But here is what most people miss: they did not just plug in
an AI tool and hope for the best. They followed a disciplined
3-step framework. And it started with one department.
