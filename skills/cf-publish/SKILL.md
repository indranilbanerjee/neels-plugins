# Publish Content — ContentForge CMS Publishing

Push publication-ready content from the ContentForge pipeline directly to your CMS (Webflow or WordPress) via MCP connectors. Preview before publishing, verify post-publish, and fall back to HTML export when no connector is available.

## When to Use

Use `/cf-publish` when:
- You have a **finished, reviewed content piece** (Phase 8 complete, score >=7.0)
- You want to **publish directly** to Webflow or WordPress without copy-pasting
- You need to **schedule content** for a future publish date
- You want **post-publish verification** (URL live, meta tags correct, images loaded)
- You want an **HTML export** for manual upload when no CMS connector is configured

**Do NOT use for:**
- Content still in pipeline (must be Phase 8 complete)
- Content flagged for human review (score <5.0)
- Platforms other than Webflow/WordPress (use `/cf-social-adapt` for social media)

## What This Command Does

1. **Verify Connector** -- Check if Webflow or WordPress MCP connector is active
2. **Load Content** -- Pull finished content from Google Drive or local output
3. **Format for Platform** -- Convert markdown/docx to platform-specific HTML/blocks
4. **Preview** -- Show rendered preview with meta tags, slug, featured image
5. **Publish/Schedule** -- Push to CMS as draft, published, or scheduled
6. **Post-Publish Verification** -- Confirm URL is live, meta tags are correct, content renders properly
7. **Fallback** -- If no connector, generate standalone HTML file for manual upload

## Required Inputs

**Minimum Required:**
- **Content Source** -- Google Drive URL, local file path, or requirement ID (e.g., `REQ-001`)
- **Platform** -- `webflow` or `wordpress`
- **Status** -- `draft`, `publish`, or `schedule`

**Optional:**
- **Schedule Date** -- ISO date/time for scheduled publishing (required if status=schedule)
- **Collection/Category** -- Webflow collection slug or WordPress category
- **Featured Image** -- URL or local path to hero image
- **Author** -- Override default author
- **Tags** -- Comma-separated list of tags
- **Slug Override** -- Custom URL slug (defaults to SEO-optimized slug from Phase 6)

## How to Use

### Interactive Mode
```
/cf-publish
```
**Prompts you for:**
1. Content source (Drive URL, file path, or requirement ID)
2. Platform (Webflow / WordPress)
3. Publish status (draft / publish / schedule)
4. Preview confirmation before pushing

### Quick Mode
```
/cf-publish REQ-001 --platform=webflow --status=publish
```

### Schedule for Later
```
/cf-publish REQ-001 --platform=wordpress --status=schedule --date="2026-03-01T09:00:00"
```

### Publish from Google Drive
```
/cf-publish https://drive.google.com/file/d/ABC123 --platform=webflow --status=draft
```

## What Happens

### Step 1: Connector Verification (5-10 seconds)

Before attempting any CMS operation, verify the target connector is available.

**Check MCP connector status:**
```
Platform: webflow
Connector: Webflow MCP (https://mcp.webflow.com/sse)
Status: CHECKING...
```

**Case A: Connector Active**
```
Webflow MCP: CONNECTED
Site: acme-corp.webflow.io
Collections available: blog-posts, case-studies, resources
Proceeding with direct publish...
```

**Case B: Connector Not Found**
```
Webflow MCP: NOT CONNECTED

No Webflow connector detected in .mcp.json.
Falling back to HTML export mode.

To enable direct publishing, add the Webflow connector:
  /dm:connect webflow

Generating standalone HTML file for manual upload...
```

### Step 2: Load and Validate Content (10-15 seconds)

**Load content from source:**
- Read .docx or markdown from Google Drive or local output directory
- Extract metadata: title, meta description, slug, keywords, author, featured image
- Validate quality score >= 7.0 (refuse to publish unreviewed content)

**Validation checks:**
```
Content Validation
---------------------------------------------------
Title: "AI in Healthcare: 2026 Trends"        OK
Quality Score: 9.2/10                          OK
Status: Approved (Phase 8 Complete)            OK
Word Count: 1,947                              OK
Meta Title: 58 chars                           OK
Meta Description: 152 chars                    OK
SEO Slug: ai-in-healthcare-2026-trends         OK
Featured Image: hero-ai-healthcare.jpg         OK
---------------------------------------------------
All checks passed. Ready to format for Webflow.
```

**Rejection cases:**
- Quality score < 7.0: "Content has not passed quality review. Score: 4.8/10. Run the full pipeline first."
- No Phase 8 completion: "Content pipeline incomplete. Phase 8 (Output Manager) has not run."
- Missing meta tags: "Meta title and description are required. Run Phase 6 (SEO Optimizer) first."

### Step 3: Format for Target Platform (10-20 seconds)

Convert ContentForge output into platform-native format.

**Webflow Formatting:**
- Convert markdown headings to Webflow rich text blocks
- Map H1 to `name` field, body to `post-body` rich text field
- Set `slug`, `meta-title`, `meta-description` fields
- Upload featured image to Webflow assets, link to `main-image` field
- Map tags to Webflow multi-reference field
- Preserve inline links, bold, italic, lists, blockquotes

**WordPress Formatting:**
- Convert markdown to WordPress Gutenberg blocks (paragraph, heading, list, quote, image)
- Set `title`, `content`, `excerpt`, `slug`, `meta` fields
- Upload featured image via media endpoint, set as `featured_media`
- Map categories and tags to taxonomy terms
- Preserve shortcodes if present in original content
- Add Yoast/RankMath SEO meta if plugin detected

**Shared formatting rules:**
- Strip .docx formatting artifacts (extra whitespace, page breaks)
- Ensure all internal links use relative paths where possible
- Validate all image URLs are accessible (no broken images)
- Preserve citation formatting (footnotes or inline links based on platform preference)

### Step 4: Preview Before Publish

Show the user exactly what will be published before pushing.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Webflow
- Uses Collection Items API for blog posts
- Rich text field supports HTML content directly
- Images must be uploaded to Webflow Assets first, then referenced
- Publish requires site publish after item creation (API call to publish site)
- CMS items are draft by default; explicit publish step needed
- Rate limit: 60 requests per minute

### WordPress
- Uses REST API v2 (`/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`)
- Gutenberg blocks preferred over classic editor HTML
- Featured image uploaded via `/wp-json/wp/v2/media`, then linked by ID
- Categories and tags are taxonomy term IDs (lookup by name first)
- Supports `date` field for scheduling
- Application Passwords or OAuth for authentication
- Rate limit: Varies by host (typically 100-500 requests/minute)

## Requirements

### MCP Integrations (Optional but Recommended)
- **Webflow MCP** (`https://mcp.webflow.com/sse`) -- For direct Webflow publishing
- **WordPress** -- Via REST API (no MCP endpoint; uses HTTP connector or direct API)

### Environment
- Claude Code or Cowork (latest version)
- Content must have completed Phase 8 (Output Manager)
- Quality score >= 7.0
