## Scripts (New)

v3.0.0 introduces a `scripts/` directory with Python utilities:

- **`setup.py`** — Runs automatically on session start via hooks. Validates Python version, reports paths, checks .mcp.json
- **`connector-status.py`** — Registry of 22 connectors across 12 categories. Powers `/cf:integrations` and `/cf:connect`

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+ (available in Cowork VM as Python 3.10)

---

## Verification Steps

After upgrading, verify everything works:

1. **Session startup** — Should show setup.py output + v3.0 banner
2. `/cf:integrations` — Should show 6 connected HTTP connectors
3. `/contentforge` — Existing pipeline should work unchanged
4. `/cf:social-adapt [article]` — Should generate social posts
5. `/cf:brief "AI tools"` — Should generate content brief

---

## Recommended Adoption Path

1. **Start with** `/cf:integrations` — understand your connector status
2. **Try** `/cf:social-adapt` — immediate value from existing content
3. **Try** `/cf:brief` — better briefs lead to better content
4. **Explore** `/cf:publish` — if you have Webflow/WordPress connectors
5. **Set up** `/cf:analytics` — start tracking quality trends
6. **When ready** — `/cf:translate`, `/cf:video-script`, `/cf:calendar`
